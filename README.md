**feedback_lite** is a *very* simple simple feedback module that makes use of the sitewide contact form.

# Why another feedback module?

There are already plenty of other solutions already available to provide feedback on Drupal.org, however we needed a very light one that would be easily themed for our client projects.

# Install

1. Download the archive or clone the repository.
1. Drop the *feedback_lite/* folder in your modules folders (*sites/all/modules* for example)
1. Go to the modules pages (*http://yoursite.com/admin/modules*)
1. Enable the hightlight.js module.
1. You will now have a little tab on the bottom right of your screen.
1. Go to admin/settings/feedbacklite (*http://yoursite.com/admin/settings/feedbacklite*) in order to disable the load of the CSS file if necessary.
